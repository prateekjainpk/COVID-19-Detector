# COVID-19-Detector
Using machine learning model to successfully detect COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays by building a Simple Convolutional Neural Network. The dataset for the project is created by merging two different data sets. 

Covid X-Ray Image Dataset (https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.git)

Kaggle X-Ray Chest Images (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

Further the dataset is divided into Train and Val data.
